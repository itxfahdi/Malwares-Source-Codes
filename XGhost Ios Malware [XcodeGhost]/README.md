"XcodeGhost" Source Clarification on the so-called "XcodeGhost"

First of all, I apologize for the confusion caused by the XcodeGhost event. XcodeGhost is derived from my own experiments without any threatening behavior, see the source code for details

The so-called XcodeGhost is actually an accidental discovery that forced iOS developers: modifying the Xcode compilation configuration text can load the specified code file, so I wrote the code in the above attachment to try and upload it to my own network disk.

All the data obtained in the code is actually the basic app information: app name, app version number, system version number, language, country name, developer symbol, app installation time, device name, device type. Apart from that, no other data was obtained. What needs to be solemnly explained is: out of selfishness, I have added an advertising function to the code, hoping to promote my own application in the future (people who are interested can check the source code of the attachment). But actually, I didn't use the advertising feature from the beginning to the final shutdown of the server. And 10 days ago, I took the initiative to shut down the server and delete all data, and it will not have any impact on anyone.

May the rumors stop with the truth, the so-called "XcodeGhost" was a misguided experiment in the past, and is just completely dead code in the future.

It should be emphasized that XcodeGhost will not affect the use of any App, nor will it acquire private data, it is just a piece of dead code.

Sincere apologies again, I wish you all a happy weekend
